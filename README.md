# Railway-Ticket-Reservation-System

This is a simple mini project of railway ticket reservation system;
This basically helps user to book tickets after user signup(user name,password,email);
After successful signup an user can login and book tickets where there are two options(book a ticket or book multiple tickets);
The booking proccess is simple after seeing train schedule & train id one can easily book a ticket or multiple tickets;
After that the system will ask the date of journey & there are two payment methods too(Debit Card, Credit Card);
An user can view & cancel tickets too(By simply putting the booking id);

This has interface of:
User Login;
User Signup;
View Train Schedule;
Book a Ticket;
Book Multiple Tickets;
Logout;
Exit;
View Booked Tickets;
Cancel Tckets;
